# IoTTi-HAMK-IoT-Platform
Instruction on how to set up an IoT Platform. We have set up the platform IBM Watson for activities typical to all IoT Platforms. Some experiements have been done in Microsoft Azure IoT Hub. 

Instructions can be found at https://github.com/TimoK2/IoT_IBMWatson_CommissioningTasks 

The instructions have been written specially the networked learning activities in mind. Networked learning means that the students, instructors and software/hardware facilities do not need to be located in the same university or university of applied sciences. 

At the time of publishing these instructions on all the learning environmet commissioning task the software and cloud platform licences are open for univeristy/university of applied sciences degree students as well for open university students and for commercially funded training groups. All the software development tools and most of the IoT Platform development tools have licences open even for commercially funded training groups. The licence conditions depend on the vendors of the software and cloud platform, software development tools and the IoT Platform development tools. The conditions may change without prior notice!
